Overview: The film query project is part java and part mySQL. The java portion connects to mysql
database which allows a user to search the database for films via a film id number as well as search for films via a keyword that matches either the film title or part of a film's description.

If a keyword matches the aforementioned information the corresponding method returns the corresponding films' information. Information from films includes: title, description, year the movie was made, the primary language the film is in as well as a list of actors that are in the film. The program is built to provide a developer the option to include such information as length of the film (in minutes). If a user enters a parameter that is about of bounds of the database such as entering a keyword that does not exist or entering an id number that is not in the database the program will let the user know and to try again.

Technologies used: Java, Eclipse, Atom, Git, mySQL

Lessons Learned: creating a java/mySQL hybrid and getting java application to speak to a mySQL database.
